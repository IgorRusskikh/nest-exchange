## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed a recent LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (e.g., 18.x or 20.x).
- You have installed [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager.
- You have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed (recommended for managing services like Redis and PostgreSQL).
- You have [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) installed (for generating JWT keys).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd nest-exchange
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration. You'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can copy `.env.example` if it exists, or create a new one.

Fill it with the necessary values. Key variables include:

- **Application & Server:**

  - `PORT=3000` (Port the application will run on)
  - `CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3001` (URL of your frontend application)
  - `NODE_ENV=development`

- **Database (PostgreSQL via Prisma):**

  - `DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"` (Replace with your actual database connection string)

- **Redis:**

  - `REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"` (For NestJS caching, session storage, etc.)
  - `RL_REDIS_HOST=localhost` (For Rate Limiter Redis instance)
  - `RL_REDIS_PORT=6379` (For Rate Limiter Redis instance)

- **JWT Authentication:**

  - `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=./keys/private.key` (Path to your JWT private key)
  - `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=./keys/public.key` (Path to your JWT public key)
  - `JWT_DEFAULT_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=15m` (Access token expiration)
  - `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN_SECONDS=604800` (Refresh token expiration, e.g., 7 days)
  - `JWT_ALGORITHM=RS256`

- **Blockchain Interaction:**

  - `INFURA_RPC_URL=` (Your RPC URL for connecting to the Ethereum network, e.g., from Infura or Alchemy)
  - `AUTH_DOMAIN=yourapp.com` (Domain used in SIWE messages)
  - `NONCE_EXPIRATION_SECONDS=300` (Expiration for authentication nonces)

- **Rate Limiter:**
  - `RL_KEY_PREFIX=rate-limit`
  - `RL_POINTS=100` (Max requests)
  - `RL_DURATION=60` (Per 60 seconds)
  - `RL_BLOCK_DURATION=600` (Block for 600 seconds if limit exceeded)

### 4. Generate JWT Keys

The application uses RSA keys for signing JWTs. You need to generate a private and public key pair.

Create a `keys` directory in the project root if it doesn't exist:

```bash
mkdir keys
```

Generate the private key:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ./keys/private.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
```

Generate the public key from the private key:

```bash
openssl rsa -pubout -in ./keys/private.key -out ./keys/public.key
```

Ensure the paths in your `.env` file for `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` and `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` match where you've saved these keys.

### 5. Set Up the Database (Prisma)

Once your `DATABASE_URL` is configured in the `.env` file and your PostgreSQL server is running (either locally or via Docker), run Prisma migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
yarn prisma migrate dev
```

This command will also generate the Prisma Client.

### 6. Running Services with Docker Compose (Optional but Recommended)

The project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file to easily run dependent services like PostgreSQL and Redis.

To start these services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start PostgreSQL and Redis in detached mode. Make sure your `DATABASE_URL` and Redis URLs in the `.env` file match the credentials and ports defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the application:

### Development Mode

For development with auto-reload on file changes:

```bash
yarn run start:dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:PORT` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` if `PORT=3000`).

### Production Mode

To build and run the application for production:

```bash
# 1. Build the application
yarn run build

# 2. Start the application
yarn run start:prod
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ yarn install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
